# Game of Life


## Description
This game was invented by John Conway the great Computer Scientist and Mathematician, where it is now  


## Rules of the Game
1.	A new cell will be born if it has EXACTLY 3 occupied neighboring cells
2.	A cell will die of loneliness if has one or fewer neighbors.
3.	A cell will also die of overcrowding if it has 4 or more neighbors.
4.	All other cells remain unchanged.
